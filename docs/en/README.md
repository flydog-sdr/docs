## What is FlyDog SDR?

![FlyDog SDR sample](/sample.jpg "FlyDog SDR sample")

As you can see, the FlyDog SDR, derived from KiwiSDR and released under the relevant open source protocol, is an SDR product that uses 16-bit ADC sampling and covers a broadband of up to 62MHz.

FlyDog SDR is currently available on a wide range of Raspberry Pi families and can be used in a variety of scenarios.

## Who is leading the FlyDog SDR Project?

The FlyDog SDR Project is led by Jie Zhi Studio.

"Jie Zhi Studio is a group of people who are passionate about radio technology and are committed to providing reliable and affordable SDR solutions for mainland Chinese gamers.

## Experience the Demo!

The FlyDog SDR Project is now offering the following examples for users to try out, all of which have been volunteered by users.

## Questions and Answers (Q & A)

Answers to questions that some people may have are given here.

### Q: What is your relationship with KiwiSDR and is it considered plagiarism?

A: FlyDog SDR is a secondary development from KiwiSDR and is completely open source, so it is not considered a copy.

### Q: Will FlyDog SDR be banned by KiwiSDR as a pirated version?

A: No, FlyDog SDR is not a pirated version and the FlyDog SDR code is in a separate repository and is not affected by KiwiSDR.

### Q: Is it possible that the FlyDog SDR maintainers will abandon the project?

A: I have heard that the similar product RaspSDR has already abandoned their project and the last code commit is still in Feb 12, 2021. However, it can be assured that FlyDog SDR will always be accountable to its users.

### Q: I've heard that there are problems with the FlyDog SDR circuit design?

A: The images previously included in the project description document were initial samples for developer testing and are completely different to the FlyDog SDR now on sale, so rest assured that there are no problems with the FlyDog SDR circuit design and it will be moving towards low noise.

### Q: How come the FlyDog SDR has three antenna interfaces?

A: Due to the wide frequency range (0-62 MHz) covered by the FlyDog SDR, some of the HF antennas may not be suitable for receiving 50 MHz amateur traffic, so the extra interface (HF-2) is also designed for receiving 50 MHz amateur traffic. The choice of antenna interface is also described in detail in the FlyDog SDR companion document.

### Q: Is the LTC2208 an inferior chip? Why not use the LTC2217, which has a lower noise floor?

A: Compared to the LTC2217, the LTC2208 has a slightly higher noise floor, but the choice of the LTC2208 as ADC was a trade-off between performance and cost. In fact, the LTC2208 is not an inferior chip at all.

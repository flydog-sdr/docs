## IMPORTANT TIPS FOR OVERSEAS BUYERS

We've recently learned of cases where users have **purchased FlyDog SDRs from AliExpress through a reseller, but received RaspSDRs instead**.

However, we don't have the authority to interfere with resellers, **so please make sure you've made agreement with them (and keep evidence) before you buy a FlyDog SDR**, which is to prevent you from being deceived and causing unnecessary damage.

The following merchants are known to be **untrusted**.

 - [HamRadioshop Store](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/4951008)

## What is FlyDog SDR?

![FlyDog SDR sample](/sample.jpg "FlyDog SDR sample")

As you can see, the FlyDog SDR, derived from KiwiSDR and released under the relevant open source license, is an SDR product that uses 16-Bit ADC sampling and covers a band up to 62MHz.

FlyDog SDR is currently available on a wide range of Raspberry Pi families and can be used in a variety of scenarios.

 - Raspberry Pi 2B
 - Raspberry Pi 3B/3B+/3A+
 - Raspberry Pi 4B

## Who is Leading the FlyDog SDR Project?

The FlyDog SDR Project is led by JieZhi Studio.

"JieZhi Studio" is a group of people who are passionate about SDR technology and are committed to providing reliable and affordable SDR solutions for mainland Chinese gamers.

## Experience the Demo!

The FlyDog SDR Project is now offering the following demos for users to try out, all of which have been volunteered by users.

## Questions and Answers (Q & A)

Answers to questions that some people may have are given here.

### Q: What is your relationship with KiwiSDR and is it considered plagiarism?

A: FlyDog SDR is a secondary development from KiwiSDR and is completely open source, so it is not considered a copy.

### Q: Will FlyDog SDR be banned by KiwiSDR as a pirated version?

A: No, FlyDog SDR is not a pirated version and the FlyDog SDR code is in a separate repository and is not affected by KiwiSDR.

### Q: Is it possible that the FlyDog SDR maintainers will abandon the project?

A: The comparable product RaspSDR seems to be very disinterested in their project. However, it can be guaranteed that FlyDog SDR will always be accountable to its users.

### Q: I've heard that there are problems with the FlyDog SDR circuit design?

A: [The image previously included in the repository README](https://i.loli.net/2020/08/28/8hHytJLSk5UlYRx.jpg) were initial samples for developer testing and are completely different to the FlyDog SDR now on sale, so rest assured that there are no problems with the FlyDog SDR circuit design and it will be moving towards low noise.

### Q: How come the FlyDog SDR has three antenna interfaces?

A: The FlyDog SDR Project provides users with two different low-pass filters (30 MHz and 62 MHz) for use. The choice of antenna interface is also described in detail in the FlyDog SDR documentation.

### Q: Is the LTC2208 an inferior chip? Why not use the LTC2217, which has a lower noise floor?

A: Compared to the LTC2217, the LTC2208 has a slightly higher noise floor, but the choice of the LTC2208 as ADC was a trade-off between performance and cost. In fact, the LTC2208 is not an inferior chip at all.

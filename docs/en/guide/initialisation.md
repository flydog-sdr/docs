## Basic System Information

## Administration

The administration is located at [flydog-sdr:8073/admin](http://flydog-sdr:8073/admin) and the default password is `flydog-sdr`.

**You need to change the default password as soon as you log in to prevent the system from being hacked by others.**

## SSH Password

SSH is enabled by default on the FlyDog SDR system. To access the terminal to debug the system, please login to the FlyDog SDR system terminal with the following authentication credentials.

| :--- | :--- |
| hostname | flydog-sdr |
| SSH port | 22 |
| username | flydog |
| password | flydog-sdr |

**Please be careful when entering the terminal to avoid errors that may prevent the device from operating properly or even losing data.** Do not use the SSH port.

**Do not open the SSH port (22) directly to the public network to avoid being hacked by others.**
